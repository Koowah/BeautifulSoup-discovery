# BeautifulSoup-discovery
Simple scrapping on python w/ BeautifulSoup &amp; requests + MultiThreading


The "final" code is in ***Craigslist Multi-threading.ipynb***.
I left the other files for those who'd wish to follow my progression and thought process.

This is my first time dabbling with scraping etc. I watched an introductory 25 minutes worth of videos from Udemy's "Learn Web Scraping with Python from Scratch" free course.

Many thanks to Nick Becker for his amazing 6 minutes read that gave me a x10 performance gain

I was so amazed by the ease of implementation of multithreading in python that it begged the question of why this wasn't in the course, or in any regular YTB scraping w/ Bs4 course ..

As soon as my schedule allows me to, i'll pursue experimenting with BeautifulSoup, write a decent readme and try to make the whole thing somewhat pedagogical :D
